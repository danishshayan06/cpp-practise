# C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my C++ practice repository! This repository contains the code and exercises I've worked on as I learn C++ programming. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, understand core C++ concepts, and build a solid foundation for advanced topics.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C++ practice problems, exercises, and small projects that I have worked on. I’m documenting my learning process as I go through various topics such as loops, functions, conditionals, and object-oriented programming. Feel free to browse the code, give feedback, or suggest improvements!

## Current Progress

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, input/output, comments.
- **Control Flow**: If-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while).
- **Functions**: Creating functions, passing parameters, return values.
- **Loops and Nested Loops**: Solving practice problems using loops.
- **Upcoming**: Arrays, strings, pointers, and object-oriented programming.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of C++ programming.
- Solve beginner-to-intermediate C++ problems.
- Build small projects and programs to apply the concepts learned.
- Understand algorithms and data structures in C++.
  


## How to Run the Code

To run any of the C++ programs in this repository:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/C++-Learning-Journey.git
   cd C++-Learning-Journey
   ```

2. **Compile and run the program:**
   Use a C++ compiler like `g++` to compile the code. For example, to run `hello_world.cpp`:

   ```bash
   g++ basics/hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
   ./hello_world
   ```

   Or, if you're using an IDE like Visual Studio or Code::Blocks, open the `.cpp` files and run them through the IDE.

## Challenges

While learning C++, I’ve encountered a few challenges, such as:

- Understanding the differences between `float`, `double`, and `int`.
- Working with loops to solve pattern problems.
- Understanding the logic behind recursive functions.
  
I’m documenting these challenges here to reflect on my learning process and track improvements.
